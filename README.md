# EVM Indexer

> Minimalistic EVM compatible blockchain indexer written in rust.

This contains a program to parse all the blocks and transactions from a blockchain to organize them inside a mongo database.

Uses an HTTPS RPC endpoint and a WSS RPC endpoint to subscribe to new blocks.

The purpose of this program is to serve as a boilerplate for a real blockchain indexer.
